# Predictive Maintenance using IBM AutoAI

This project predicts industrial machine failures using sensor data and IBM Watson AutoAI.

## Problem

Industrial machinery can fail unexpectedly, causing downtime and high costs.  
Goal: Predict failures like tool wear, heat issues, and power failures using machine learning.

## Solution

- Used IBM AutoAI to build and deploy a predictive model  
- Trained on a Kaggle dataset of sensor readings  
- Selected Snap Random Forest Classifier as the best model
